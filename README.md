# 3D-Agricultural-Skills-Training
By utilizing 3D models, the project enhances the understanding of agriculture, allowing students to
navigate through the lifecycles of plants and delve into the complexities of modern farming practices. The
project introduces an immersive learning platform designed for the comprehensive understanding of plant
growth and cultivation. It also identifies the diseases and teaches us how to cure the plants. The focus on
simulating the complete lifecycle of plant development offers a unique educational experience, enabling
students to explore the complexity of agriculture in a simulated yet realistic environment.
